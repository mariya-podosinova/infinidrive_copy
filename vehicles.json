They were apparently created at the behest of Yavanna after she learned of AulÃ«'s children, the dwarves, knowing that they would want to fell trees. Becoming shepherds of the trees, they protected certain forests from orcs and other perils. The Elves had tales of teaching the trees and the Ents to talk: although the Ents were sentient beings at the time, they did not know how to speak until the Elves taught them. Treebeard spoke of the Elves curing the Ents of their dumbness, an unforgettable gift.",
